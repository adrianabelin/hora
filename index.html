						<div id="paragraph1"><br><br>We are a non-profit organization with a passion to enrich<br> Minnesota’s diverse cultural landscape by preserving and sharing the <br>valuable heritage of the Romanian American community. The Romanian <br>community in Minnesota was established around the early 1900s. Driven by <br>poverty and the hope for a better life, Romanians began arriving as part of a <br>larger Eastern European wave of immigrants, settling mainly in St. Paul and South <br>St. Paul. While Romanian immigration decreased significantly after WWII and the <br>spread of Russian Communism, it picked back up after the fall of European commun-<br>ism at the end of the 1980s.

		<br><br>Motivations for immigration, as well as cultural and social backgrounds,<br> are highly diverse. A great effort is underway to document the incred-<br>ible stories of Romanians immigrating to Minnesota over the<br> last century.</div>
		<br><br><br>
			<div id="title1">Our goals</div>
			<div id="paragraph2"><br><br>
			◆ Informational Resource of Romanian <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;heritage, culture, history, current<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  events, and community involvement.<br><br>

			◆ Host quarterly events to promote and  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;present various aspects of the Romanian  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cultural heritage. HORA will explore the  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interests of the public and develop future events  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;accordingly.<br><br>

			◆ Showcase Romanian Americans who have achieved <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;important standings in their Minnesota community or <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in the United States at large.<br><br>

			◆ To collaborate with other like-minded organiza-tions in Minnesota <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and abroad.

						The hidden valley of Maramures stretches for sixty miles through a fold in the rugged Carpathian Mountains of Romania along the Ukrainian border. Nestled among its rolling hills the village of Ieud spreads out along a mountain stream for nearly four miles. Population in the village is reckoned by counting the columns of smoke rising in the icy winter air. With five or six people huddled around each warm hearth, five hundred columns suggests that the village numbers around 3000 people. <br><br><figure id="button"></figure><br></div>
